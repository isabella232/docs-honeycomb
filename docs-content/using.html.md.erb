This topic describes how to use Honeycomb Nozzle for PCF.

After installation, the Honeycomb Nozzle for PCF transparently sends log events to Honeycomb.

##<a id="events"></a> View Events

To see the events:

* Log in to your Honeycomb account.
* You will see several new Datasets prefixed by the letters `CF` (eg `CF Logs`, `CF Errors`, etc.)
* Click through to one of them and begin constructing queries!
** Each application running on your PCF installation has its own `app ID` and `name`
** Try a Breakdown by `logAppId` and `logAppName` and a Calculation of `COUNT` - this will show you the volume of traffic per app in your system.

For more details on how to use Honeycomb, refer to the [Honeycomb docs](https://docs.honeycomb.io)

##<a id="statistics"></a> View Statistics

To see statistics that the nozzle reports to Honeycomb:

1. Log in to https://honeycomb.io.
1. Use the **Log Messages** dataset.
1. Under the **Samples** tab, check the field named **hnyNozzleAppID**.
1. Record the value you see there. It should look something like `f787b2bb-e2e6-4d66-9cc0-e5491ebedbf3`.
1. In the query builder, apply a filter: **logAppId = YOUR-APP-ID**<br>
   Where YOUR-APP-ID is the value recorded in the step above.

  After building this query, you see one event per second reporting the total number of events parsed and any errors.

##<a id="troubleshooting"></a> Troubleshooting

If you don't see any events showing up in Honeycomb, do the following:

* Verify that the Write Key works for sending events to Honeycomb via curl. You should get a 200 response back and see the dataset created 
and see the event in the **Samples** tab on the top of the screen.
```
  curl https://api.honeycomb.io/1/events/TestCurl -X POST -H "X-Honeycomb-Team: YOUR-WRITE-KEY-HERE" \
  -d '{"key":"val","key2":"val2"}' -vvv
```
* Check the logs for the tile (via the `cf logs`command in a terminal) for anything that looks like an error, for example:

  * Trouble talking to the CF API
  * Trouble authenticating with the CF API

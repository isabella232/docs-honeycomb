##<a id='create'></a> Create an Account on Honeycomb

Before you install the Honeycomb Nozzle for PCF tile, you need to have an account on Honeycomb. If you have an existing account, record the team Write Key for that account; no need to create a new one.

Complete the following steps to set up a Honeycomb account:

1. Follow the instructions at https://honeycomb.io/signup to create a Honeycomb account and choose a team name.

2. Record your team Write Key from https://ui.honeycomb.io/account.

Complete the following steps to create a UAA user that gives the Nozzle access to the Firehose and Cloud Controller.

1. Install the UAA Command Line Interface (CLI) tool, uaac:

    ```
    $ gem install cf-uaac
    ```

2. Use the `uaac target uaa.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` command to target your UAA server, for example:

    ```
    $ uaac target uaa.sys.example.com
    ```

3. Record the `uaa:admin:client_secret` from either:
    * The cf deployment manifest
    * The Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the Pivotal Elastic Runtime tile, click **Credentials**, **UAA** > **Admin Client Credentials**

4. Authenticate to UAA using the `client_secret` from the previous step:

    ```
    $  uaac token client get admin -s ADMIN-CLIENT-SECRET
    ```

5. Create a Honeycomb Nozzle user with a password of your choice:

    ```
    $ uaac -t user add honeycomb-nozzle-user --password PASSWORD --emails na
    ```

6. Add the user to the Cloud Controller Admin Read-Only group:

    ```
    $ uaac -t member add cloud_controller.admin_read_only honeycomb-nozzle-user
    ```

7. Add the user to the Doppler Firehose group:

    ```
    $ uaac -t member add doppler.firehose honeycomb-nozzle-user
    ```

For information about creating a UAA user, see [Creating and Managing Users with the UAA CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/uaa-user-management.html).

  * **Write Key**: See [Create an Account on Honeycomb](#create) above.
  * **Sample Rate**: Start with 1 here, and increase it to reduce the amount of data you send to Honeycombâ€”will send 1 event for every n received.
  * **Send Metrics**: The PCF Firehose reports both log events and metrics:
      * Set to **true** to send both metrics and log events to Honeycomb.
      * Set to **false** to drop metrics and only send log events to Honeycomb (recommended).
  * **Skip SSL Verification**: Set this to **true** if you are not using SSL or your SSL certificates don't have a path back to a known root authority.
  * **UAA API user account name**: Enter the user you added using the uaac client (`honeycomb-nozzle-user` in the example above).
